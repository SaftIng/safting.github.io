## Short historical overview

We are the Semantic Application Framework Saft Engineering Taskforce (Saft.Ing), a couple of developers with a strong background in Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. Some of us previously worked, some still are working, on Erfurt the PHP/Zend based Semantic Web Framework, which is the foundation e.g. for the collaborative Semantic software OntoWiki and the node for the Distributed Semantic Social Network Node xodx. k00ni created Enable in 2013/2014 during his study as a lightweight alternative to Erfurt. After half a year, he teamed up with the OntoWiki and Erfurt maintainer white_gecko and they decided to establish a fully fledged collection of components to build applications by using Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. They used their experience with Erfurt and code from Enable to start. These two were joined by vitaB, who mostly contributed code to the Store and REST components.
