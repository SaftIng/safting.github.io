## What is Saft?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which help anyone who wants to create applications by using Semantic Web/Linked Data technology. It is also an integration platform which provides support for foreign libraries, such as [ARC2](https://github.com/semsol/arc2) and [EasyRdf](http://www.easyrdf.org/), to solve certain tasks, such as parsing/serialization or triple store access. That is transparent for the user and he does not have to care about the underlying structure. 

The main goal of Saft is to provide a full fledged middleware, which supports a wide range of use cases in the Semantic Web field, from data consuming, data manipulation, querying and database/store interaction.

The project structure can be devided into [_saft.library_](/doc/phpframework), containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure, and the [_saft.skeleton_](/doc/phpframework), which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.

### Short historical overview

The founding developers previously worked, some still are working, on Erfurt the PHP/Zend based Semantic Web Framework, which is the foundation e.g. for the collaborative Semantic software OntoWiki and the node for the Distributed Semantic Social Network Node xodx. k00ni created Enable in 2013/2014 during his study as a lightweight alternative to Erfurt. After half a year, he teamed up with the OntoWiki and Erfurt maintainer white_gecko and they decided to establish a fully fledged collection of components to build applications by using Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. They used their experience with Erfurt and code from Enable to start. These two were joined by vitaB, who mostly contributed code to the Store and REST components and by Oliver Skawronek, which layed the ground for a file based triple store.

## What is SaftIng?

SaftIng stands for *Semantic Application Framework Saft Engineering Taskforce* (Saft.Ing), which is a group of developers with a strong background in Semantic Web and Linked Data technology.
