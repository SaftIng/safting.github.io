_Saft_ is a framework with the aim to specify components needed for software engineers to easily implement web applications using Semantic Web technology.
For the interface towards the World Wide Web a [REST interface is specified](restinterface).
It allows read and write access to the data served by a Store-Service.
For server side implementation of Semantic Web applications, e.g. implementing a Store-Service for the World Wide Web, we provide the [Saft PHP framework](phpframework).
