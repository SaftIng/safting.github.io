The data package should provide interfaces for parsind and serializing RDF data in various formats.
Somehow we have to manage which serializations are supported and we have to manage different backends (e.g. redland, own php or some other things).
Maybe the [PHP Stemas API](http://php.net/manual/en/book.stream.php) will be relevant for this part of _Saft_.
