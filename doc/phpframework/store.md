Package _saft.store_ consists of Triple- and Quadstore related classes and interfaces. Its purpose is to provide a foundation to built a store implementation on.

## Main parts

### StoreInterface

It describes, which methods a store implementation has to provide. We propose to implement it in other languages if you need a store implementation, to have the best compatibility between different implementations.
