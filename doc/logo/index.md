# Logo

The _Saft_ contains a glass of juice (German: “Saft”) with an altering flavor and fruit beside it, the project name is prefixed with the flavor and is printed somewhere next to the glass and fruit. The flavor indicates the projects current version.

For adjusting the colors in Tango-juice.svg I've done the following color substitutions in the SVG file: d1ba03 -> 3bba03, fce52a -> 3be52a and 8e7f02 -> 3b7f02. Maybe the color should better fit to the kiwi next to it :-D
