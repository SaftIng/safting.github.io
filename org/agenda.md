This page contains information about the roadmap of the Saft project.

## Version 0.1

The purpose of the first release is to lay the ground for further development. We want to finish the main APIs, such as Store interface. Furthermore, it will already contain a couple of adapters, for cache and store interaction.

In a nutshell:

- a first proposal for the APIs of:
    - _Saft.rdf_
    - _Saft.data_
    - _Saft.store_
- 100% tests coverage
- 100% api documentation
