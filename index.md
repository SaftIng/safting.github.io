## What is Saft and what is it supposed to be?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which helps anyone who wants to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.

It consists of the [_saft.library_](/doc/phpframework) containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure and the [_saft.skeleton_](/doc/phpframework)  which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.
The whole code is supposed to be free and open source software, but we haven't decided for a license yet.
