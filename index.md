_Semantic Application Framework Saft_ Engineering Taskforce

## What is Saft and what is it supposed to be?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which helps software developers to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.
It consists of the _saft.library_ containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure and the _saft.skeleton_ which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.
The whole code is supposed to be free and open source software, but we haven't decided for a license yet.

## Getting Started

Currently there is not much to use but we have some ideas and structures already formulated in the [Documentation](doc).
If you are curious about the existing code and project structure you should also take a look at the [github account](https://github.com/safting).
