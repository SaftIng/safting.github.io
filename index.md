_Semantic Application Framework Saft_ Engineering Taskforce

## What is Saft and what is it supposed to be?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which helps software developers to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.
It consists of the _saft.library_ containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure and the _saft.skeleton_ which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.
The whole code is supposed to be free and open source software, but we haven't decided for a license yet.

### Short historical overview

We are SaftIng and are a couple of developers with a strong background in Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. Some of us previously worked, some still working, at [Erfurt](https://github.com/AKSW/Erfurt), which is a PHP/Zend based Semantic Web Framework for Social Semantic Software written with PHP. [k00ni](https://github.com/k00ni) created [Enable](https://github.com/k00ni/Enable) in 2013/2014 during his study as a lightweight alternative to Erfurt. After half a year, he teamed up with [white_gecko](https://github.com/white-gecko) and they decided to establish are fully fledged collection of components to build applications by using Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. They used their experience with Erfurt and code from Enable to start. These two were joined by [vitaB](https://github.com/vitaB), who mostly contributed code to the Store and REST components.

Currently there is not much to use but we have some ideas and structures already formulated in the [Documentation](doc).
If you are curious about the existing code and project structure you should also take a look at the [github account](https://github.com/safting).
