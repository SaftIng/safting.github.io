## What is Saft?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which helps anyone who wants to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.

It consists of the [_saft.library_](/doc/phpframework) containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure and the [_saft.skeleton_](/doc/phpframework)  which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.
The whole code is supposed to be free and open source software, but we haven't decided for a license yet.

For further information about the project goals, please have a look at the [About](/about) page.

## Getting started

Saft grows rapidly and can be very overwhelming at the beginning. If you want to dive in directly, please have a look into the examples: https://github.com/SaftIng/Saft.example. This is a good starting point to check out parts of Saft. We tried to make the examples as clear as possible.

## Integration

We provide integration packages for different systems to help you using Saft inside them.
