## What is Saft?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which helps anyone who wants to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.

It consists of the [_saft.library_](/doc/phpframework#saft-library) containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure and the [_saft.skeleton_](/doc/phpframework#saft-skeleton-application-saftskeleton)  which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.
The whole code is supposed to be free and open source software, but we haven't decided for a license yet.

For further information about the project goals, please have a look at the [About](/about) page.

## Getting started

In this section you will find information how to start using Saft.

#### Examples

If you want to dive in directly, please have a look into [Saft.example](https://github.com/SaftIng/Saft.example). This is a good starting point to check out parts of Saft. We tried to make the examples as clear as possible.

#### Documentation

Our documentation grows with the code and contains primarly information about Saft and its components. Please have a [look](http://safting.github.io/doc).

## Integration

We provide integration packages for different systems to help you using Saft inside them.

#### for Wordpress

That plugin provides an integration of Saft into Wordpress. Currently, we support ARC2 to be used as store and integrated into active MySQL-database from WordPress, which means, it uses the same access credentials from the `wp-config.php` file.

#### for Drupal7
