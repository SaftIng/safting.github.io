## What is Saft and what is it supposed to be?

_Saft_ is the aim to build a collection of components which helps software developers to create applications by using Semantic Web technology.
It consists of the _saft.library_ containing interfaces and components which can be included in any existing application structure and the _saft.skeleton_ which helps developers to bootstrap an application from the scratch.
The whole code is supposed to be free and open source software, but we haven't decided for a license yet.

### Short historical overview

We are _Saft.Ing_ and are a couple of developers with a strong background in Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. Some of us previously worked, some still are working, on [Erfurt](https://github.com/AKSW/Erfurt) the PHP/Zend based Semantic Web Framework, which is the foundation e.g. for the collaborative Semantic software [OntoWiki](http://aksw.org/Projects/OntoWiki) and the node for the Distributed Semantic Social Network Node [xodx](http://aksw.org/Projects/Xodx).
[k00ni](https://github.com/k00ni) created [Enable](https://github.com/k00ni/Enable) in 2013/2014 during his study as a lightweight alternative to Erfurt. After half a year, he teamed up with the OntoWiki and Erfurt maintainer [white_gecko](https://github.com/white-gecko) and they decided to establish a fully fledged collection of components to build applications by using Semantic Web and Linked Data technology. They used their experience with Erfurt and code from Enable to start. These two were joined by [vitaB](https://github.com/vitaB), who mostly contributed code to the Store and REST components.
